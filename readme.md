## Regex Components

### Anchors

### Quantifiers
- Greedy Quantifier:  `?` Expression example: `ath?`

The `?` at the end of the search pattern means that the last character `h` is an optional search pattern, after the search pattern of `at`. In this case all characters containing `at` within the body of the text will be found by this expression example, and where `h` is found after `at` - will also be found in the search pattern. The below search pattern example will show how the search is performed.
